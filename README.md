## Tech Stack
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient data storage
- **Backend**: Express.js for robust API development
- **Frontend**: React.js for dynamic and interactive UI
- **Server**: Node.js for scalable backend operations

## Getting Started

1. Ensure MongoDB is running – If using MongoDB locally, start the MongoDB service by running mongod. If using MongoDB Atlas, ensure your connection string is correctly configured in the .env file.
2. Clone the repository – Open a terminal and run git clone <repository_url> to download the project files. Navigate to the project folder using cd <project_folder>.
3. Install dependencies – Navigate to the frontend folder and install the required packages with cd client && npm install. Then, move to the backend folder and install dependencies with cd ../server && npm install.
4. Start the application – Run the frontend using npm start inside the client folder, which will launch the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. Start the backend by running nodemon inside the server         folder, which will initialize the backend on http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port).
